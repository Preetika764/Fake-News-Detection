# Fake-News-Detection

We are using autoencoders for fake news detection on the Twitter and Weibo datasets. After training the autoencoder, reconstruction error is measured for each of the test images. If the error is above the defined threshold, the point is classified as false. Otherwise, it's classified as real news.
